## Introduction

I am Aziz, and I am a refugee. I studied the Internet and wide-area networks,
and I have some experience in programming.
You can call me Zizi.
I'm interested to see how much I can expand my skills in programming languages.

> How can we find the sweet spot between creating, developing and making sure
they're well-researched?

## Interests

* Learning New Languages: Exploring different programming languages to find
the most useful and efficient ones for my projects. I believe that learning through
trial and error is the best way to learn.

* Computers & Technology: Since getting my first computer, I've been fascinated
with hardware, files, and operating systems which I was always tinkering with.

> *Do you know something that might be useful for me?*

### Hobbies üë®‚Äçüíª

Ever since I got my first computer at a young age, I became very interested in
computers and I was always searching and messing around with hardware, files and
operating systems until I got to know the concept of programming and I try to
learn new things every day.
I love trial and error to find the right way.

My main computer hobby is making errors.

> How can you fix an error when you don't have enough knowledge?

Let's work together to push the boundaries of what's possible. By combining our
skills and perspectives, we can create something amazingü§ù.
