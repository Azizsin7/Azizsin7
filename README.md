## Featured Projects

### See-Sense: AI-Driven Carbohydrate Estimation for Type 1 Diabetes Management

[Repository](https://github.com/Azizsin7/See-Sense)

**Overview:**
  A research-driven AI system using computer vision to automatically identify
  food items and estimate carbohydrate content for Type 1 Diabetes management.
  This clinically-validated solution aims to reduce the cognitive burden of
  manual carbohydrate counting, a critical component of insulin dosing
  decisions.

**Key Achievements:**

- Implemented EfficientNetB0 deep learning model with 91.9MB footprint
- Created gold standard dataset with 5,000+ validated, clinically-reviewed
  images
- Optimized for consumer-grade GPU deployment (RTX 3050, 3.2GB VRAM)
- Achieved sub-100ms inference speed with mixed precision (FP16) training
- Implemented clinical safety auditing with carbohydrate bucketing validation

**Technical Architecture:**

- **Framework:** TensorFlow 2.15+ / Keras
- **Optimization:** Mixed Precision Training, Memory Limiting
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, Pillow
- **Interface:** Real-time camera integration with Tkinter GUI
- **Hardware Target:** NVIDIA RTX 3050/3000 series (3.2GB VRAM)

**Project Goals:**

1. Build clinically-validated gold standard dataset
2. Optimize for consumer hardware deployment
3. Ensure clinical safety through carbohydrate bucketing
4. Achieve high classification accuracy and reliability
5. Deploy user-friendly real-time applications

### DataCure: Mental Health Chatbot Failure Analysis

[Repository](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-20-repo)

**Overview:**
  A collaborative data science research project analyzing conversational
  failures in mental health chatbots. Conducted as part of the MIT Emerging
  Talent Collaborative Data Science Program (CDSP), this research explores
  the effectiveness and limitations of AI-driven versus human support in
  digital mental health applications across diverse cultural contexts.

**Research Focus:**

- **Program:** MIT Emerging Talent CDSP (Track 6)
- **Domain:** Digital Mental Health & Emotional Support Technologies
- **Timeline:** May – August 2025
- **Team:** DataCure – A cross-cultural research collaboration

**Research Question:**

- What are the most prevalent themes of user-reported conversational failure
  in leading mental health chatbots, and what do these themes reveal about the
  gap between user expectations for emotional support and current algorithmic
  capabilities?

**Key Objectives:**

1. Systematically identify and categorize common user-reported chatbot failures
2. Quantify failure prevalence using public app store and forum data
3. Compare failure patterns between conversational AIs and baseline wellness apps
4. Generate actionable insights for developing more empathetic digital care tools
